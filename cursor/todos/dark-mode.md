# Dark Mode Implementation

## Memory
- `src/style/_vars.scss` - Main location for theme variables
- `src/wireframes/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Controls the AntDesign theme configuration
- Dark mode colors are defined in `src/style/_vars.scss` and `src/wireframes/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- The application uses both SASS variables for styling and theme tokens for Ant Design components
- Toggle for dark mode is in `src/wireframes/components/page-layout/Layout.tsx`
- Shape components use `ThemeShapeUtils.ts` to get the current theme and apply appropriate colors
- Text elements (Label, Paragraph, Heading, etc.) now use theme-aware colors for better dark mode visibility
